## Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game you can play in your browser.
1. Setup skeleton HTML/CSS/JS
2. Create a Game Module, Board Object, Player Object (tip: if you only need 1, use a module; else use factories)
3. setup html and render contents
4. Allow players to move, then tie it to the DOM (click); validate
5. check for victory
6. keep score, track time, restart button

### Bonus - AI
- Start by just getting the computer to make a random legal move.
- Once you’ve gotten that, work on making the computer smart. It is possible to create an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm (read about it here, some googling will help you out with this one)
- If you get this running definitely come show it off in the chatroom. It’s quite an accomplishment!
